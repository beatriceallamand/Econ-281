Part 1: "Micro data fact OR causal effect"

## Positioning Statement
Are differences in consumption across space predictable by differences in output, production across space?
- Local consumers choose to consume from an aggregator of products produced in different regions, and choose to save in a capital aggregator supplying resources to firms in different regions. 
- Prices of consumption goods and interest rate of capital are such that the local and aggregate markets clear
- 

## Research Question

## Answer

## Data
I can see how differently consumption per state and employment per state have changed over the years


Is consumption response to MP shocks predictable by employment effects? 
- Real measures of marginal costs

Part 2: "Sketch of model that connects micro data to macro outcome"

# Do wealth effects in labor supply create an aditional challenge for the identification of the Phillips Curve? 

If instead of assuming GHH preferences we assumed CES, we would observe that marginal cost deviations from trend are a combination of consumption and hours worked deviations from trend. Now, assume deviations in labor equalized deviations in output (or are a linear function and therefore controlling for that closes the deal), but not consumption because there is trade. 
Then, not considering regional consumption in the regression for the regional Phillips curve would imply omitting a relevant variable. Like inflation expectations or cost-push shocks, a deviation of consumption from trend will translate to higher prices at any level of output/unemployment. However, in open economies its relationship with slackness is not easy to predict.  

What is interesing about considering the possibility of consumption being an omitted variable is that demand shocks might now violate the exclusion restriction! 

Most demand shocks the literature considers are assumed to instrument for ex-ante endogenous movements in demand to trace out the supply curve. But if we now consider that the demand shock also affects inflation directly, not throught demand but through consumption (in the error term), this violates the exclusion restriction for any instrument of the kind. 

Short comments given that we discussed in class at some length. I think in general any misspecification in which marginal costs are not just linear functions of output are a problem. Examples: wealth effects, capital, ...

Can you construct regional consumption measures that you can control for? Are wealth effects the most important among these channels that induce misspecification?
