## Idea 1: Lumpy Durables and Ammunition + Keynesian Effects
This idea explores the asymmetry in monetary policy transmission—specifically, why contractionary shocks tend to reduce output and consumption more effectively than expansionary shocks stimulate them. Standard explanations emphasize the lower bound on nominal interest rates or state dependence (Berger et al, 2021) in policy effectiveness. I instead build on McKay and Wieland (2021) and Kaplan et al. (2018) to explore a complementary mechanism based on the interaction of lumpy durable consumption + indirect or Keynesian effects + asymmetric wage rigidities.

Durable goods are subject to intertemporal substitution: during an expansionary shock, some households—typically Ricardian or near-Ricardian agents—bring forward durable purchases in response to lower interest rates, boosting current consumption. This direct response is relatively small in aggregate terms. According to Kaplan et al. (2018), only about 5% of the cumulative consumption response to monetary shocks occurs through this direct intertemporal substitution channel. The remaining 95% comes from indirect or Keynesian effects: higher durable demand raises labor demand in affected sectors, leading to wage increases, which in turn support additional consumption among a broader group of households. This indirect response is central to the overall effectiveness of monetary policy.

As McKay and Wieland (2021) emphasize, however, there is an inherent intertemporal tradeoff. By stimulating durable consumption today, policymakers deplete future demand—particularly once interest rates return to normal levels. Under flexible wages, this future drop in demand reduces labor demand in durable-producing sectors, driving wages back down and muting the indirect effects over time. In this baseline case, the Keynesian amplification mirrors the nature of the direct response: "limited ammunition of monetary policy"

However, if wages are not fully flexible in the reversion, this feedback loop weakens. Following an expansionary shock, the initial rise in durable demand pushes up wages (assume: flexibly), but when demand recedes, wages may not fall proportionally. This incomplete wage adjustment sustains consumption via indirect channels even after the direct substitution effect has faded. In this way, wage rigidity can counteract the expected reversal implied by intertemporal substitution, muting the decline in aggregate consumption that would otherwise occur when interest rates normalize. GDP or Consumption IRFs may not follow Durables IRP as close as we would expect as under fully flexible wages.

Now I introduce asymmetry. Suppose wages respond flexibly on impact to a monetary policy shock—whether contractionary or expansionary (there are good reasons to believe this which I could argue but is not the purpose of this document). The key difference emerges during the period when interest rates begin to normalize and wage stickiness becomes more relevant. If wages are more flexible upward than downward—as many firms and employer organizations suggest—then after an expansionary shock, the initial boost to durable consumption raises wages, but when durable demand subsides, wages do not fall easily. This downward rigidity sustains higher income and, through the Keynesian channel, supports elevated consumption even after the direct effect of the monetary shock has dissipated. If the shock is contractionary, the wage will decrease on impact, and when the reversion asks for wages to adjust upwards, they will flexibly respond. As a result, aggregate consumption or GDP departs more from the IRF of durables following expansionary shocks than contractionary shocks, due to the persistence of the indirect effect.

By contrast, if wages are more flexible downwards than upwards, after an expansionary shock, the initial boost to durable consumption raises wages, but when durable demand subsides, wages fall flexibly. After a contractionary shock, however, the initial bust to consumption increases wages and the following decrease in consumption does not imply wages decrease as much. Here, aggregate consumption or GDP departs more from the IRF of durables following monetary expansions rather than contractions. 

I propose to test this hypothesis empirically using Romer-Romer monetary shocks. I plan to estimate impulse responses of GDP, durable consumption, and proxies for lumpy durable spending such as car acquisition probability and household mobility. I will also estimate wage and employment responses—ideally disaggregated by durable vs. non-durable sectors—to evaluate the strength and asymmetry of the indirect channel. I aim to distinguish the effects of positive versus negative shocks to test for directional asymmetries in wage rigidity, and to compare high- versus low-interest-rate regimes to account for potential state dependence in monetary transmission.

## Idea 2: Micro Keynesian Jumps - Macro Ricardian Humps
I wonder if we can also fit micro jumps and macro humps by a framework with investment convex + fix adjustment costs and labor-capital complementarities. 
- Micro “jumps” are intertemporal MPCs: the micro responses of consumption to transitory income shocks.
- Macro “humps” are the aggregate consumption responses to persistent shocks, such as monetary policy shocks. In the data, these responses have delayed peaks.
Under a specific parametrization of a HA model, only a small fraction of agents can/will respond to the interest rate substituting consumption intertemporally. This generates the response of consumption on impact. It will be muted not because their iMPC is small, but because they constitute a small fraction of the economy. Although small, their increase consumption stimulates demand, incentivicing firms to increase production. However, firms are characterize by a cost adjustment hazard that makes their investment decision and optimal capital choice stochastic and sluggish, like Caballero and Engel (1999). Each period, a fraction of firms will adjust, so the investment decision will produce a humped IRF for investment. Because of capital-labor complementarities, the competitive wage will follow the investment IRF. Therefore, the income all households perceive will be proportional to the investment sluggishness. Then, the indirect effects through consumption are directly linked to investment, not through the return on assets, but through labor income!
