## Comments on 1st Submission - Class Project

1. I realized because I uploaded a PDF, there is no space for you to right your comments, so I opened this for that purpose.
2. I also notice I missed an institutional background that actually challenges identification. Retirement age for men is also at 65 years old in Chile, so it is not obvious that the effect around the threshold is due to PGU and not meeting the
   age for retirement. There two ways around that: (1) As I propose, I can compare the RD of 2022 to the RD of a previous (pre PGU) wave. A more formal strategy could be Dif-Dif.
   (2) For woman, retirement age is at 60, so 65 is only a relevant threshold for PGU -so the wealth shock is well identified-. If I run the RD only on woman I will observe the effect of PGU and not retirement age.

# Juan's Comments:

Hi Bea,

I think this is an interesting question to explore. I am not convinced about the design.

## Treatment only at 65.

I am unclear on why you expect to find effects on labor supply at 65 but not before. Workers who are 60 suddenly receive news of increases in income in the future, therefore increases in permanent income today, increasing their consumption today and reducing hours. Now think of a person 30 years old. This person received some news about income at retirement, which presumably acts qualitatively the same as for a person 60 years old, with the obvious difference of the effect of discounting. But now this person anticipates increases in future taxation to pay for the universal pension. Whether this person increases or decreases labor supply will be a function of whether in net this is an increase or decrease in permanent income for this individual.

### Bea:
- effects on young: (1) wealth might also increase for them but discounting might be large, (2) they expect to be taxed in the future = if any, effect should be smaller. 
- effects on people about at the threshold: (1) discount=0, they receive the extra income right away, (2) will not live to pay increases in taxation.
- Extra: Here I will talk like a journalist rather than like an economist. About ricardian equivalence concerns (1) the polcy was partially founded by changes in taxation exemptions for particular industries (mining), but is largely unfounded. So yes, economist could think people expect taxes to go up eventually. (2) However, in Chile, labor taxes are only paid by monthly income above ~US $1.200 which represent around 25% of the workforce. For most of the affected households, if they were to rationally compute the expected tax they will pay for this, it will be low both because of the quantity and the probability. There are two reasons for that (1) as mentioned, labor income is very progressive and most people are exempted. (2) There has been attempts to increase taxation but mainly related to firms taxes, however, nothing is likely to happen in the next 5 years. And with 0 probability anyone will even attempt to broaden the tax base in the near future. Concluding, there might be something like ricardian equivalence going on through the firm's side, decreasing job demand (but this should not differentially affect demand for 64,99 vs 65 years old). The firms could anticipate some taxes will go up in the future. But from the perspective of the workers, I doubt this is relevant. I could be proved wrong. 

In other words, the coefficient \tau for me is not the causal effect of PGU, even if 65 did not coincide with other discontinuous changes in labor status. I think your argument only works in a model with Hand-to-mouth consumers, where labor supply today is a function of consumption today, and consumption today is a function of income today only. Deviations from that imply that the whole demographic pyramid will be treated with a strength that depends on structural parameters (like time preferences), elasticities of intertemporal substitution, and deviations from PIH.

Wondering if you think I'm wrong.
### Bea:
- Summing up: effect on the threshold is comparing the people that have not yet turn 65 to those who have therefore measuring eligibility to the wealth transfer. I agree I'm not sure is wealth effect, but I think it speaks to that. I think I could use a model to decompose the different forces at play and see what exactly I identify.

### Frisch.

One assumption in your research design is that wages of workers of different ages does not move in response to the reform. That is a good assumption if the labor markets of elegibile workers are integrated. But what happens if they are segmented? If fewer people decide to participate in the labor market, would not the wage for these workers differentially change? And as a response, would not labor supply responses also contain information on the Frisch elasticity and not on wealth effects exclusively?

#### Bea: 
I agree in general, the market for people in retirement age is not the same as those that are further from the threshold. Byt I think there are good reasons to beleive that the market of workers 64 + 364 days old is similar to those aged 64 + 365. So I believe the RD design controls for that.


## For Friday's meeting

I replied your questions here and we can discuss this answers.
I will try to bring a sketch of model to help disentangle the treatment effect into wealth effects + other things.
