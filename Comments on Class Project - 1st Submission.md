## Comments on 1st Submission - Class Project

1. I realized because I uploaded a PDF, there is no space for you to right your comments, so I opened this for that purpose.
2. I also notice I missed an institutional background that actually challenges identification. Retirement age for men is also at 65 years old in Chile, so it is not obvious that the effect around the threshold is due to PGU and not meeting the
   age for retirement. There two ways around that: (1) As I propose, I can compare the RD of 2022 to the RD of a previous (pre PGU) wave. A more formal strategy could be Dif-Dif.
   (2) For woman, retirement age is at 60, so 65 is only a relevant threshold for PGU -so the wealth shock is well identified-. If I run the RD only on woman I will observe the effect of PGU and not retirement age.
