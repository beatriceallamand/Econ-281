# (1) Monetary Union and State-Dependance

Motivated by Chodorow-Reich (2019), Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) and Woodford (2011). The cross-sectional or open economy relative multiplier provides a measure of the effect of fiscal stimulus, differencing out the -constant across space- response in monetary policy.
New work (Donaldson, -) has shed light on conditions under which the aggregate response would not be effectively differenced out with this procedure.

I ask the question: Can pre-existing deviations from average conditions help inform the non-uniform exposition to -an otherwise constant across regions- monetary policy response? 
Suppose the monetary authority chooses interest rates according to a Taylor rule, observing employment-weighted deviations from inflation target and short run output in all regions.
Using the same policy rule, we could compute the optimal policy for each region. 
Imagine a region is experiencing higher inflation than average, such that it's optimal policy rate is higher than the Monetary Union's one. For this region, the deviation from optimal policy
is large, relative to the average region. After the fiscal stimulus spreads across the economy, monetary policy response to average inflation is still lower than the region's optimal policy
before the shock, therefore, the relative response in terms of converging to target seems slower. Can a measure like this help account for the non-uniform exposition to monetary policy?

Another measure of pre-existing deviations from average condition can be computed from the idea of slackness for fiscal policy, i.e. how steep the marginal cost curve is in each region. In some regions, there is slackness and a fiscal stimulus generates increase production without much cost increase, relative less slack regions. That provides a distinct measure of ideal interest rate response across space that could help adress the research question. A related issue is briefly discussed in Chodorow-Reich (2019), when they cite forces like lower facto prices or congested labor markets in generating state-dependent multipliers.

# (2) Debt Payment and Credit Supply

Motivated by Pinardon-Touati (2023). If local government borrowing crowds out local investment through capacity/credit supply constraints, should we expect shocks to debt payment increase credit supply for all interest rate levels?
And therefore have positive effects on aggregates such as investment and output?

A possible natural experiment to test this implication is Chile's pension funds withdrawals. Between 2020 and 2021, Chilean congress gave non-retired participants three separate opportunities
to tap into their retirement accounts, leaving 4.2 million participants with zero retirement savings and draining $50 bn from the system. During the same period, the government issued a large transfer
called IFE. In those two years, a total amount of $71 bn was injected into the economy, equivalent to approx. 1/3 of the annual GDP.

According to several surveys, the main use of these funds was consumption. However, the second most important destination was debt payment. Most commentators attribute a the extraordinary 11.3% GDP
growth in 2021 to these extra consumption, but could it be the case that debt payment improved firm's credit conditions?

Data that could be leveraged:
- Comisión para el mercado financiero (CMF): A lot of public information on monthly financial states of each bank in Chile. 

Households surveys:
- EOD: gathers information about whether or not households received the fiscal stimulus (called IFE), whether or not they withdrew a part of their pension savings and what they did with 
  the money. EOD also collects information about general demographics, employment status and wages. Some descriptive statistics show that 2/3 of the households that received IFE vs. 1/3 
  of those who withdrew funds, use these resources for consumption, with the second most answered use being paying debts.

- Encuesta Financiera de Hogares (EFH): account balances, real and financial assets (including bonds, stocks, ownership of private companies, housing, other real estate properties and vehicles)
  and debts (including mortgage, educational, auto, retail and consumer loans). Previous works report linking surveyed households to information of withdrawals through pairing significant statistics. 

Administrative data: The Pensions Superintendency collected data on the social security affiliates’ withdrawals and pension balances.
