## Lemon Entrepeneurs
After reading Bierdel, Drenik, Herre√±o and Ottonello (2025), I became very curious about the macroeconomic effects one can derive from describing the relationship between firms and lenders in an asymetric information framework.
The literature of financial frictions and misallocation is about moral hazard. Moll's argument in "Productivity Losses from Financial Frictions: Can Self-Financing Undo Capital Misallocation?" and Buera and Karmakar older argument expressed in "Real Effects of Financial Distress: The Role of Heterogeneity" is about entrepeneurs facing collateral constraints, precisely because lenders believe the entrepeneurs might run off with their savings. Then, lenders only lend each firm up to a fraction of the firms/entrepeneurs savings. This explains why if the moral hazard (the risk of the borrower running away with the money) is parametrized as 1/lambda, the collateral constraint would be k<lambda*a. Lenders insure themselfs against the risk of the borrower running away by asking for a collateral, which they will keep if they run. 
There are reasons to believe, however, that the real life lender (bank, investment firm, mutual fund, etc.) not only makes an assesment of the risk of the firm running away with the money, but also makes a risk assesment of the *profitability of the project*. For example, Entrepeneurs pitch their ideas to investors, trying to convince them of their quality. The investors take costly actions to screen the true quality of the project of the entrepeneurs, they go to meetings, order financial analysis, etc. Based on their analysis, they choose if they are interested in lending, and if so, which will be the terms of trade of that lending. 
I am interested of how this model could have different predictions for the financial development and missallocations literature. The cited papers conclude that under the most likely state space, self-financing can actually undo capital missallocations due to undeveloped financial systems. Here, we could find that wealth is not necessarily a relevant signal for quality and therefore, the missallocation caused by asymetric information in the borrowing/lending market is not mitigated through self-financing. Remember the mechanism is not that productive entrepeneurs completely finance their projects with savings, but they can finance their overall debt at a lower rate, which will not necessarily be a feature in this equilibrium. 
Pursuing a model like this could help rationalize some empirical results from the misallocation literature that I have already thought about (Idea N7 of the summer ideas). Imagine a screening technology is available at a fix cost at the local credit market. Then a shock to aggregate
capital available could make it optimal to invest into the technology where before the shock it was not optimal. This model could rationalize decrease in misallocation due to financial liberalization, not because foreign investors are better at monitoring and screening, as Bau and Matray (2023) suggested happened in India, but just because of a scale concern regarding investment at developing economies' local markets. If the pre-reform local credit market is already at a scale in which the screening technology is implemented, then additional funds would appear to replicate the local allocation rule, and therefore not improve or reproduce allocative efficiency, as seen in Spain by Gopinath et al. (2017).
The next steps for this project would be to explore data that can microfound the main mechanism, to see the factibility of bulding this model. 

## Finance Bros Bleed in Busts, Boomers in Booms?
As I made evident on Thursday, I was actually enthusiastic about Kekre and Lenel (2021). I like how straightforward the argument is. Given an initial distribution of wealth and savings allocation, imagine 50%-50% of retirees (with risk aversion of 1) vs finance bros (with risk aversion of 0) are holding risky assets. Then the risk premium is proportional to the risk aversion of the average risk holder, i.e. 0.5. Now an expansionary monetary policy comes, increasing inflation, reducing the wealth of the retirees relative to the finance bros. Because of that, the representative risk holder is 90% finance bro, 10% retiree, so it has a risk aversion of 0.1. The risk premium must decrease proportionally. 
What I found missing in the paper was evidence of the *mechanism*. The paper did include relevant empirics, however, they mainly focus on documenting the relationship between the risk premium and monetary policy. While there is no hope of identifying the primitive risk aversion of the average risk holder in the economy before and after a monetary policy shock (or perhaps, at anytime), I think their claim could be defended by observing market results that should be consistent with the hypothesis. If theres is no evidence of these market objects, then the argument is weaker. If there is evidence, that would make the argument more relevant for policy analysis. In this idea, I outline two main empirical exercises I would perform in order to test the relevance of the mechanism outlined in the model, which have nothing to do with measuring fundamental risk aversion fundamentals across wealth holders.
The first fact to document is that the return of holding capital increases after an expansionary monetary policy. The paper describes the theoretical mechanism by which this is relevant (the increased demand after an expansion will translate to more sales and more profits rebates). However, the literature is mixed about how the prices of assets react to monetary policy. The risk premium actually being one of the "puzzling" sets of evidence. How prices react is informative of the value of holding equity, since the price of companies should fully reflect the present discounted value of future cash flows, perpetuity or fundamental value. I would run local projections of monetary policy shocks to asset prices (elusive because of the risk premium!), profit rebates, or any source of return to hold equity I can find. 
The second aspect we need to verify is that the wealth held in risk free or less risky assets decrease after a monetary expansion, and increase after a monetary contraction, and by how much. While the mechanism in the paper might be obvious (nominal debt -bonds- is denominated in monetary values so as inflation increases it devaluates), perhaps the effects are muted in equilibrium. An example of how this could happen is our monetary policy shocks affect inflation, but the responses are of smaller magnitude than the volatility implied by the business cycle or the aggregate monetary policy. It could also be the case that more elements are afecting the equilibrium object. Maybe the institutional investors in risk free assets already internalize the effect of monetary policy in a way that implies they diversify against the monetary policy rule and offer *real* risk free instruments to retirees. For instance, the bank that I had in Chile (Banco Santander) offered term deposits denominated in real terms. This are examples I can think off right now, but actually, I am not super concerned about proving this side of the story because we can always define the risk free asset as the nominal bond, and then their result is almost mechanic: as long as monetary policy is effective at affecting inflation, a contractionary monetary shock would appreciate nominally denominated wealth and an expansionary monetary shock would devaluate nominally denominated wealth.
This is purely an empirical exploration to understand more about the relevance of the theoretical exercise.
