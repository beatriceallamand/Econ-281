    "These ideas can be about how to extend the paper, how to test the paper, or how to apply the paper to a different context."

Comments:
- The literature of financial frictions and misallocation is about moral hazard, not asymetric information!
- Moll's paper "Productivity Losses from Financial Frictions: Can Self-Financing Undo Capital Misallocation?" and Buera and Karmakar older argument expressed in "Real Effects of Financial Distress: The Role of Heterogeneity". This firms have different types (TFP). Entrepeneurs face collateral constraints meaning they can only borrow up to a fraction of their savings. The classical motivation for this type of constraint is moral hazard (the risk of the borrower running away with the money is 1/lambda, then the collateral is k<lambda*a).
- This is wild! How does this interact with my ideas for macro dev of capital misallocation?
